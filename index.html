As you develop an effective marketing strategy for your business, understanding the differences between the two is crucial.</div>

					<div class="post-title">How to Harness the Power of AI in Digital Marketing</div>
					<div class="excerpt">There’s no denying that technology has dramatically changed the way we live, work, and play. The same is true for AI in digital marketing. In fact, many of the tools used by digital marketers today were initially developed to automate tasks in fields such as medicine and robotics. So it makes sense that AI—a type of machine learning whereby computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed, also known as artificial intelligence—would eventually come into play as well. This article will cover what AI is, how it works, and how companies use it today.</div>

					<div class="excerpt">Search engine optimization (SEO) can often be a challenging code to decipher, especially when there are several different types of SEO.

					<div class="post-title">Set It And Forget It? No, Your Website Needs Ongoing Maintenance</div>
					<div class="excerpt">A common misconception is that once a website has been completed, no ongoing website maintenance is required to keep it up and running. I’m not talking about maintenance like adding new features and promoting it. I’m talking about maintenance to continue to make it accessible to your customers. In its most basic definition, a website is nothing more than some software running on a computer (server) somewhere. That server also has other software that serves up your website to your customers. When you think about it in those terms, it is easier to see why ongoing website maintenance is needed. Regardless of if you use Mac OSX or Windows, your computer’s operating system requires ongoing updates to protect you against hackers and fix bugs. When Windows updates, sometimes the software on your computer will stop working, and you need to wait for an update from the provider for it to work again. Websites are the same way.</div>
